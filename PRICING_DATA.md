## Pricing Assumptions Used in Audit Engine

### Inactive Seat Definition
A seat is considered "inactive" if it has:
- Zero logins in the last 30 days, OR
- Fewer than 5 prompts/requests in the last 30 days

This threshold is conservative to avoid false positives.

### Utilization Rate Calculation
```
utilizationRate = activeSeats30d / totalSeats
```

Where `activeSeats30d` = seats with at least 1 login and 5+ prompts in the last 30 days.

### Low Utilization Thresholds
| Provider | Threshold | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| ChatGPT | < 10 prompts/user/month | Less than 1 prompt every 3 days |
| Claude | < 20 prompts/user/month | Less than 1 prompt per workday |
| Cursor | < 10 prompts/user/month | Less than 1 coding session every 3 days |
| Copilot | < 5 prompts/user/month | Less than 1 coding session per week |
| Gemini | < 15 prompts/user/month | Less than 1 prompt every 2 days |

These thresholds are based on typical usage patterns from user interviews and industry benchmarks.

### API vs Subscription Overlap
A workspace is flagged for API/subscription overlap if:
- `apiSpend > $500/month` AND
- `subscriptionSpend > $1000/month` for the same provider

This indicates the team is paying for both API access and seat licenses, which may be redundant.

### Plan Downgrade Criteria
| Current Plan | Recommended Downgrade | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| ChatGPT Team | ChatGPT Plus | ≤ 5 seats AND < 3 sessions/user/month |
| Claude Team | Claude Pro | ≤ 5 seats AND < 20 prompts/user/month |
| Cursor Business | Cursor Pro | < 10 prompts/user/month AND no privacy mode usage |
| Copilot Business | Copilot Individual | < 5 prompts/user/month AND no org management needed |

1. Visit the official pricing page for each vendor
2. Update the price in this document
3. Update the corresponding constant in `src/lib/audit-engine.ts`
